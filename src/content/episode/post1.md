Welcome to the premier episode of "The Daleen Dossier: Career & Product Strategies." I'm your host Aliyah Daleen, where each conversation is a new piece in the puzzle of your career and product leadership journey.

Today, we are honored to have a special guest whose life work epitomizes the boundless pursuit of growth, both professionally and personally. A true beacon in the world of longevity, wellbeing, and the art of sustainable behavioral change, we're joined by the Co-Founder of the Longevity Hub, a noted Behavioral Science enthusiast, and a TEDx speaker who has illuminated stages with insights into healthy lifestyles, not just living longer, but living better.

Who is this paragon of strategic living, you ask? Someone who has dedicated their path not only to uncovering the secrets to lasting health but integrating those principles with the cutting-edge disciplines of behavioral change and behavioral science, to help individuals and organizations alike harness their ultimate potential.

In an era when our work and personal lives increasingly intertwine, understanding the principles of health and longevity is paramount. Our guest's unique perspective bridges this gap, teaching us that the key to a robust product, career, and life is rooted in the very fabric of our daily habits and thought patterns.

They say "it's not the years in your life, but the life in your years," and our guest epitomizes this philosophy. We will delve into their transformative insights and breakthrough concepts on healthy aging, holistic well-being, how to implement lasting behavioral change, and the quintessential understanding of how behavioral science can sculpt the workplaces of tomorrow.
